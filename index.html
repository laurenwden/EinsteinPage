            <li>He is commonly referred to as the "people's scientist" because of his sense of humor and approachability.</li>
            <li>His family believed his head was oversized. </li>
            <li>At 17, he renounced his German citizenship to avoid having to go into the military.</li>
            <li>He didn't speak his first words until 3 or 4 years of age. His reponse when asked why he hadn't spoken up to that point was "because up to now, everything was in order."</li>
            <li>Einstein's brain can be viewed today at the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia.</li>
            <li>He gave out autographs and photos for a fee and donated the money to charity.</li>
            <li>There is a periodic element named after him despite him making no contribution to its discovery.</li>
            <li>He was spied on by the FBI because he was believed to be a radical and a communist.</li>
            <li>Einstein's life could have been longer. When offered surgery, he refused becuase he believed in dying a natural death and that not doing so was "tasteless".</li>
            <li>After his death, Einstein's eyeballs were given to his doctor. Today they are stored in a safety deposit box in New
            York City.</li>
